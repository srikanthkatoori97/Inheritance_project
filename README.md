# Inheritance_project
this project clears describes the inheritance concepts while using the help of constructors.
here we have used one super class called animal
There are 3 subclasses for the animals class which are reptile,bird and fish
there is an each subclass for all the subclasses which are
reptile--->crocodile
bird--.>eagle
fish--eel
there are different properties for different classes and some of the parent properties are inherited by the child classes and that can be claelry depicted through 
this program.
